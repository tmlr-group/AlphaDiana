## Core Concepts

### 1. Graph Definition

**Formal Definition**:
```
Graph G = (V, E) where:
- V = finite set of vertices (nodes)
- E ⊆ V × V = set of edges (connections)

For undirected graphs: E is set of unordered pairs {u,v}
For directed graphs: E is set of ordered pairs (u,v)
```

**Python Representation**:
```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Set, Tuple, Optional

@dataclass
class Graph:
    """Abstract graph representation"""
    vertices: Set[int]
    edges: Set[Tuple[int, int]]
    directed: bool = False

    def __post_init__(self):
        """Validate graph structure"""
        for u, v in self.edges:
            if u not in self.vertices or v not in self.vertices:
                raise ValueError(f"Edge ({u},{v}) references non-existent vertex")

    def order(self) -> int:
        """Number of vertices |V|"""
        return len(self.vertices)

    def size(self) -> int:
        """Number of edges |E|"""
        return len(self.edges)

    def degree(self, v: int) -> int:
        """Degree of vertex v"""
        if v not in self.vertices:
            raise ValueError(f"Vertex {v} not in graph")

        if self.directed:
            # In-degree + out-degree for directed graphs
            in_deg = sum(1 for _, target in self.edges if target == v)
            out_deg = sum(1 for source, _ in self.edges if source == v)
            return in_deg + out_deg
        else:
            # Number of incident edges for undirected
            return sum(1 for u, w in self.edges if u == v or w == v)

# Example usage
undirected = Graph(
    vertices={1, 2, 3, 4},
    edges={(1,2), (2,3), (3,4), (4,1)},
    directed=False
)

directed = Graph(
    vertices={1, 2, 3},
    edges={(1,2), (2,3), (3,1)},
    directed=True
)
```

### 2. Graph Types

**Classification by Edge Direction**:
```python
class GraphType:
    """Common graph classifications"""

    @staticmethod
    def is_undirected(graph: Graph) -> bool:
        """Edges have no direction: {u,v} = {v,u}"""
        return not graph.directed

    @staticmethod
    def is_directed(graph: Graph) -> bool:
        """Edges have direction: (u,v) ≠ (v,u)"""
        return graph.directed

    @staticmethod
    def is_mixed(edges: Set) -> bool:
        """Contains both directed and undirected edges"""
        # Requires custom edge representation
        pass

# Undirected: Social networks (friendship is mutual)
# Directed: Web graphs (link A→B doesn't imply B→A)
# Mixed: Road networks (some one-way, some two-way)
```

**Classification by Edge Weights**:
```python
@dataclass
class WeightedGraph(Graph):
    """Graph with weighted edges"""
    weights: dict[Tuple[int, int], float] = None

    def __post_init__(self):
        super().__post_init__()
        if self.weights is None:
            self.weights = {}

        # Validate weights match edges
        for edge in self.weights:
            if edge not in self.edges:
                raise ValueError(f"Weight for non-existent edge {edge}")

    def weight(self, u: int, v: int) -> Optional[float]:
        """Get edge weight, None if edge doesn't exist"""
        edge = (u, v) if self.directed else tuple(sorted([u, v]))
        return self.weights.get(edge)

# Weighted: Road networks (distances), social networks (strength)
# Unweighted: Simple connectivity (edge exists or doesn't)
```

**Special Graph Classes**:
```python
class SpecialGraphs:
    """Factory for common graph types"""

    @staticmethod
    def complete_graph(n: int) -> Graph:
        """Kₙ: Every vertex connected to every other
        |V| = n, |E| = n(n-1)/2"""
        vertices = set(range(n))
        edges = {(i, j) for i in range(n) for j in range(i+1, n)}
        return Graph(vertices, edges, directed=False)

    @staticmethod
    def cycle_graph(n: int) -> Graph:
        """Cₙ: Vertices in circular arrangement
        |V| = n, |E| = n"""
        vertices = set(range(n))
        edges = {(i, (i+1) % n) for i in range(n)}
        return Graph(vertices, edges, directed=False)

    @staticmethod
    def path_graph(n: int) -> Graph:
        """Pₙ: Linear chain of vertices
        |V| = n, |E| = n-1"""
        vertices = set(range(n))
        edges = {(i, i+1) for i in range(n-1)}
        return Graph(vertices, edges, directed=False)

    @staticmethod
    def bipartite_graph(left: Set[int], right: Set[int],
                       edges: Set[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Graph:
        """G = (L ∪ R, E) where edges only between L and R"""
        if left & right:
            raise ValueError("Partitions must be disjoint")

        vertices = left | right
        # Validate edges only cross partitions
        for u, v in edges:
            if (u in left and v in left) or (u in right and v in right):
                raise ValueError(f"Edge {(u,v)} within partition")

        return Graph(vertices, edges, directed=False)

    @staticmethod
    def tree(n: int, edges: Set[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Graph:
        """Connected acyclic graph with n vertices, n-1 edges"""
        vertices = set(range(n))
        if len(edges) != n - 1:
            raise ValueError(f"Tree must have {n-1} edges, got {len(edges)}")

        graph = Graph(vertices, edges, directed=False)
        # Would need connectivity/acyclicity check
        return graph

# Examples
K5 = SpecialGraphs.complete_graph(5)  # 5 vertices, 10 edges
C6 = SpecialGraphs.cycle_graph(6)     # Hexagon
P10 = SpecialGraphs.path_graph(10)    # Linear chain

        total = sum(graph.degree(v) for v in graph.vertices)
        return total / graph.order()

    return degree_sum == 2 * graph.size()
```

    """Graph connectivity analysis"""

    @staticmethod
    def is_connected(graph: Graph) -> bool:
        """Path exists between every pair of vertices (undirected)"""
        if not graph.vertices:

    @staticmethod
    def is_strongly_connected(graph: Graph) -> bool:

        if not graph.directed:

            components.append(component)

## Patterns

### Pattern 1: Graph Modeling

## Anti-Patterns

### ❌ Confusing Directed and Undirected
```python
# WRONG: Treating directed as undirected
def degree(graph, v):
    return sum(1 for u, w in graph.edges if u == v or w == v)
    # Fails for directed graphs

# CORRECT: Check graph type
def degree(graph: Graph, v: int) -> int:
    if graph.directed:
        in_deg = sum(1 for _, target in graph.edges if target == v)
        out_deg = sum(1 for source, _ in graph.edges if source == v)
        return in_deg + out_deg
    else:
        return sum(1 for u, w in graph.edges if u == v or w == v)
```

### ❌ Ignoring Edge Cases
```python
# WRONG: Assume graph is non-empty
def analyze(graph):
    max_deg = max(graph.degree(v) for v in graph.vertices)
    # Crashes on empty graph

# CORRECT: Handle empty graphs
def analyze(graph: Graph) -> dict:
    if not graph.vertices:
        return {"order": 0, "size": 0, "max_degree": None}

    return {
        "order": graph.order(),
        "size": graph.size(),
        "max_degree": max(graph.degree(v) for v in graph.vertices)
    }
```

### ❌ Inefficient Degree Calculation
```python
# WRONG: Recalculate degrees repeatedly
for v in vertices:
    if graph.degree(v) > threshold:  # O(|E|) each call
        process(v)

# CORRECT: Cache degrees
degrees = {v: graph.degree(v) for v in graph.vertices}  # O(|E|) once
for v in vertices:
    if degrees[v] > threshold:  # O(1) lookup
        process(v)
```
