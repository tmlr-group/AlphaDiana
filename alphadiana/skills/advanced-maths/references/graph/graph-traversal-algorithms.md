## Core Algorithms

### 1. Breadth-First Search (BFS)

**Concept**: Explore graph level by level from source vertex

**Properties**:
- **Time**: O(V + E) with adjacency list
- **Space**: O(V) for queue and visited set
- **Finds**: Shortest paths in unweighted graphs
- **Order**: Visits vertices by distance from source

```python
from collections import deque
from typing import List, Set, Dict, Optional

def bfs(graph: 'AdjacencyList', start: int) -> Dict[int, int]:
    """
    Breadth-first search from start vertex

    Returns:
        distances: dict mapping vertex to distance from start

    queue = deque([start])

    while queue:
        u = queue.popleft()

        for v in graph.neighbors(u):
            if v not in visited:
                visited.add(v)
                distances[v] = distances[u] + 1
                queue.append(v)

    return distances

    """

    Returns:

                distances[v] = distances[u] + 1
                parents[v] = u
                queue.append(v)

    return distances, parents

def reconstruct_path(parents: Dict[int, Optional[int]],
                    target: int) -> Optional[List[int]]:
    """Reconstruct path from source to target using parent pointers"""
    if target not in parents:

    path = []
    current = target

    while current is not None:
        path.append(current)
        current = parents[current]

    return list(reversed(path))

# Example usage
from graph_data_structures import AdjacencyList

graph = AdjacencyList(6, directed=False)
graph.add_edge(0, 1)
graph.add_edge(0, 2)
graph.add_edge(1, 3)
graph.add_edge(2, 3)
graph.add_edge(3, 4)
graph.add_edge(4, 5)

distances, parents = bfs_with_parents(graph, start=0)
path_to_5 = reconstruct_path(parents, 5)
print(f"Shortest path 0→5: {path_to_5}")  # [0, 1, 3, 4, 5]

## Patterns

### Pattern 1: Traversal with Custom Actions
```python
def dfs_with_actions(graph: 'AdjacencyList',
                     start: int,
                     pre_action: Callable[[int], None],
                     post_action: Callable[[int], None]):
    """Generic DFS with custom pre/post actions"""
    visited = set()

    def dfs(u: int):
        visited.add(u)
        pre_action(u)  # Execute on entry

        for v in graph.neighbors(u):
            if v not in visited:
                dfs(v)

        post_action(u)  # Execute on exit

    dfs(start)

# Example: Print entering/leaving messages
dfs_with_actions(
    graph, start=0,
    pre_action=lambda u: print(f"Entering {u}"),
    post_action=lambda u: print(f"Leaving {u}")
)
```

### Pattern 2: Early Termination
```python
def dfs_find(graph: 'AdjacencyList', start: int,
             predicate: Callable[[int], bool]) -> Optional[int]:
    """DFS that terminates early when predicate is satisfied"""
    visited = set()

    def dfs(u: int) -> Optional[int]:
        visited.add(u)

        if predicate(u):
            return u

        for v in graph.neighbors(u):
            if v not in visited:
                result = dfs(v)
                if result is not None:
                    return result

        return None

    return dfs(start)

# Example: Find vertex with degree > 5
target = dfs_find(graph, start=0, predicate=lambda v: graph.degree(v) > 5)
```

| BFS | O(V+E) | O(V) | Shortest paths (unweighted) |
| DFS | O(V+E) | O(V) | Cycles, topological sort, SCCs |
| Topological (DFS) | O(V+E) | O(V) | DAG ordering |
| Topological (Kahn) | O(V+E) | O(V) | DAG ordering, cycle detection |
| Kosaraju SCC | O(V+E) | O(V) | Strongly connected components |
| Tarjan Bridges | O(V+E) | O(V) | Critical edges |

### When to Use Which
- **BFS**: Level-order traversal, shortest paths, bipartiteness
- **DFS**: Cycle detection, topological sort, components, backtracking
- **Topological Sort**: Task scheduling, dependency resolution
- **SCCs**: Web crawling, social network analysis

## Anti-Patterns

### ❌ Not Handling Disconnected Graphs
```python
# WRONG: Only traverses from vertex 0
visited = bfs(graph, start=0)
# Misses disconnected components

# CORRECT: Traverse all components
all_visited = set()
for start in range(graph.num_vertices):
    if start not in all_visited:
        visited = bfs(graph, start)
        all_visited.update(visited)
```

### ❌ Modifying Graph During Traversal
```python
# WRONG: Remove edges during DFS
def dfs(u):
    for v in graph.neighbors(u):
        graph.remove_edge(u, v)  # Modifies during iteration!
        dfs(v)

# CORRECT: Collect then modify
def dfs(u, to_remove):
    for v in graph.neighbors(u):
        to_remove.append((u, v))
        dfs(v, to_remove)
```

### ❌ Assuming DAG Without Checking
```python
# WRONG: Topological sort without cycle check
result = topological_sort_dfs(graph)
process(result)  # Crashes if result is None

# CORRECT: Check for cycles first
result = topological_sort_dfs(graph)
if result is None:
    print("Graph has cycle - no topological ordering")
else:
    process(result)
```

## Summary

Graph traversal algorithms provide systematic exploration of graph structure:
- **BFS**: Level-by-level, finds shortest paths in unweighted graphs
- **DFS**: Depth-first, detects cycles, computes topological order
- **Topological Sort**: Orders DAG vertices respecting dependencies
- **SCCs**: Finds maximal mutually reachable subgraphs in directed graphs

**Key takeaways**:
1. BFS and DFS both run in O(V+E) time with adjacency lists
2. BFS uses queue (FIFO), DFS uses stack/recursion (LIFO)
3. DFS postorder enables topological sort and SCC algorithms
4. Always handle disconnected graphs by iterating over all vertices
5. Check for cycles before topological sort on directed graphs

**Next**: Move to `shortest-path-algorithms.md` for weighted path algorithms.
