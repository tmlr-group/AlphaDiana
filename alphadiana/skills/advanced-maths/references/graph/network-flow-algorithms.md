## Core Concepts

### Flow Network

**Definition**: Directed graph G = (V, E) with:
- **Source** s ∈ V: Flow originates here
- **Sink** t ∈ V: Flow terminates here
- **Capacity** c: E → ℝ⁺: Maximum flow on each edge
- **Flow** f: E → ℝ: Actual flow on each edge

**Flow Properties**:
```
1. Capacity constraint: 0 ≤ f(u,v) ≤ c(u,v) for all (u,v) ∈ E
2. Flow conservation: ∑f(u,v) = ∑f(v,w) for all v ∈ V \ {s,t}
                      (in)      (out)
   (Flow in = flow out for non-source/sink vertices)
3. Value of flow: |f| = ∑f(s,v) - ∑f(u,s)
                        (out of s)  (into s)
```

**Maximum Flow Problem**: Find flow f with maximum value |f|

## Core Algorithms

### 1. Ford-Fulkerson Method

**Concept**: Iteratively find augmenting paths and increase flow

**Key Ideas**:
- **Residual graph** Gf: Shows remaining capacity
- **Augmenting path**: Path from s to t in residual graph
- **Max-flow min-cut theorem**: Max flow value = min cut capacity

```python
from typing import Dict, List, Tuple, Optional
from collections import defaultdict, deque
import math

- **Space**: O(V + E)
- **Guarantees**: Finds max flow in polynomial time

            if u == sink:
                # Reconstruct path and find bottleneck
                path = []
                node = sink

### 3. Minimum Cut

**Concept**: Partition vertices into sets S and T such that s ∈ S, t ∈ T, minimizing capacity of edges crossing cut

**Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem**: Maximum flow value = minimum cut capacity

```python
def find_min_cut(network: FlowNetwork, source: int, sink: int
                ) -> Tuple[set, set, List[Tuple[int, int]], float]:
    """
    Find minimum cut after computing maximum flow

    Must run max flow algorithm first!

    Returns: (S, T, cut_edges, cut_capacity)

          T = unreachable from source
          cut_edges = edges crossing from S to T
    """

                cut_capacity += network.capacity[u][v]

    return S, T, cut_edges, cut_capacity

# Example usage
network3 = FlowNetwork(6)
network3.add_edge(0, 1, 16)
network3.add_edge(0, 2, 13)

### 4. Bipartite Matching via Flow

**Concept**: Maximum bipartite matching reduces to maximum flow problem

**Reduction**:
1. Create source s connected to all left vertices (capacity 1)
2. Create sink t connected to all right vertices (capacity 1)
3. Direct edges from left to right (capacity 1)
4. Max flow = maximum matching size

```python
def maximum_bipartite_matching(left_vertices: set,
                               right_vertices: set,
                               edges: List[Tuple[int, int]]

    """

    Returns: List of matched pairs
    """
    # Create flow network
    num_vertices = len(left_vertices) + len(right_vertices) + 2
    source = num_vertices - 2

    network = FlowNetwork(num_vertices)

    # Source to left vertices (capacity 1)
    for u in left_vertices:
        network.add_edge(source, u, 1)

    # Right vertices to sink (capacity 1)
    for v in right_vertices:

### Push-Relabel Algorithm

**Concept**: Maintain preflow (local excess allowed), push flow forward, relabel vertices

**Properties**:

- **Space**: O(V + E)
- **Advantage**: Faster on dense graphs, parallelizable

## Patterns

### Pattern 1: Algorithm Selection
```python
def choose_flow_algorithm(graph_info: dict) -> str:
    """Select optimal max flow algorithm"""
    num_vertices = graph_info["num_vertices"]
    num_edges = graph_info["num_edges"]
    max_capacity = graph_info.get("max_capacity", math.inf)

    if max_capacity < 100 and num_vertices < 1000:
        return "Ford-Fulkerson (DFS)"  # Simple, works for small capacities

    if num_edges < num_vertices ** 1.5:
        return "Edmonds-Karp"  # Good for sparse graphs

    return "Push-Relabel"  # Best for dense graphs
```

### Pattern 2: Flow Decomposition

def decompose_flow(network: FlowNetwork, source: int, sink: int, flow_dict: dict
                  ) -> List[Tuple[List[int], float]]:
    """

## Quick Reference

### Algorithm Comparison
| Algorithm | Time | Space | Best Use Case |
|-----------|------|-------|---------------|
| Ford-Fulkerson (DFS) | O(E × \|f*\|) | O(V) | Small integer capacities |
| Edmonds-Karp (BFS) | O(V × E²) | O(V) | General purpose, polynomial |
| Push-Relabel | O(V² × E) | O(V) | Dense graphs |

### Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem
```
max_flow(s, t) = min_cut(S, T)

where S = vertices reachable from s in residual graph
      T = vertices not reachable from s
```

---

## Anti-Patterns

### ❌ Not Checking Undirected Graphs
```python
# WRONG: Flow algorithms for directed graphs only
undirected_graph = ...
max_flow = edmonds_karp(undirected_graph, s, t)  # Incorrect!

# CORRECT: Convert undirected to directed (both directions)
for u, v in undirected_edges:
    network.add_edge(u, v, capacity)
    network.add_edge(v, u, capacity)  # Reverse edge
```

### ❌ Forgetting Integer Capacities for Ford-Fulkerson
```python
# WRONG: Ford-Fulkerson with large/fractional capacities
network.add_edge(0, 1, 1e9)  # May take 10⁹ iterations!

# CORRECT: Use Edmonds-Karp for large capacities
max_flow = edmonds_karp(network, s, t)  # Polynomial time
```

## Summary

Network flow algorithms solve capacity-constrained optimization problems:
- **Ford-Fulkerson**: Augmenting path method, O(E × |f*|)
- **Edmonds-Karp**: BFS-based augmenting paths, O(V × E²)
- **Min Cut**: Partition with minimum capacity, equals max flow
- **Bipartite Matching**: Reduces to max flow problem

**Key takeaways**:
1. Max-flow min-cut theorem: Maximum flow = minimum cut capacity
2. Edmonds-Karp guarantees polynomial time via BFS shortest paths
3. Bipartite matching, edge-disjoint paths reduce to max flow
4. Residual graph guides augmenting path search
5. Push-relabel often faster on dense graphs

**Next**: Move to `advanced-graph-algorithms.md` for specialized algorithms.
