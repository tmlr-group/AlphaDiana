## Preconditions

Dashboard runs on top of the existing AlphaDiana environment. Please complete the Quick Start in the main README or install manually:

```bash
source scripts/activate.sh
pip install -e '.[all]'   # or pip install -e '.[all,dev]'
```

Node.js >= 18 (for building the frontend).

> **Important: after pulling new code or updating the Python package, always re-run the environment update steps before starting the dashboard:**
>
> ```bash
> source scripts/activate.sh
> pip install -e '.[all]'           # pick up new Python dependencies
> cd alphadiana/dashboard/frontend
> npm install && npm run build       # rebuild frontend (if frontend files changed)
> cd ../../..
> ```
>
> In development mode (`./run.sh` without `--prod`), the frontend reloads automatically on save — `npm run build` is not needed. In production mode (`./run.sh --prod`), a build is required for changes to take effect.

---

## Installation

### 1. Install Dashboard dependencies


```bash
source scripts/activate.sh
pip install -e '.[dashboard]'
```


This will additionally install `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `httpx`.

### 2. Build the frontend


```bash
cd alphadiana/dashboard/frontend
npm install
npm run build
cd ../../..
```


> Re-run `npm run build` after modifying frontend code, except in development mode.

---

## Start

### Recommended method: use run.sh


```bash
source scripts/activate.sh

cd alphadiana/dashboard
./run.sh # Development mode: frontend hot reload + backend auto reload
./run.sh --prod # Production mode: serve the frontend and backend on one port
```


After startup:
- Development mode: Browser access `http://localhost:5173` (Vite dev server, supports hot update)
- Production mode: Browser access `http://localhost:8000`

If the default port is occupied, `run.sh` will automatically detect and switch to the next available port, and output the actual port used in the terminal.

### Manual start

If you need to control the front and back ends separately:


```bash
# Terminal 1: Launch Backend
source scripts/activate.sh
uvicorn alphadiana.dashboard.backend.main:app --reload --port 8000

# Terminal 2: Launch Frontend (Dev Mode)
cd alphadiana/dashboard/frontend
VITE_BACKEND_PORT=8000 npm run dev
```


### Use the backend only (frontend already built)


```bash
source scripts/activate.sh
uvicorn alphadiana.dashboard.backend.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
# Browser access http://<host>:8000
```

## Page Features

### Runs (historical results)

Lists the evaluation results corresponding to all `.jsonl` files in the `results/` directory, supporting:

- Sort by time and accuracy
- Search and filter (run ID, agent, benchmark)
- Enter the Compare page after multiple selections
- Click on any row to enter Run Detail

**Multiple sample results (num_samples > 1)** additionally display pass@k and avg@k metrics.

### Run Detail (single run)

Complete view of a single assessment:

| Block | Content |
|------|------|
| Summary | Total accuracy, pass@k, avg@k, classification score, token usage |
| Score Matrix | True or false matrix for each sample of each question (automatically displayed when multiple samples are taken) |
| Time Chart | Time-consuming distribution of each task (histogram) |
| Token Chart | Token usage distribution for each task |
| Config | Corresponding YAML configuration (automatically saved to `configs/` by Dashboard) |
| Results Table | For the score, answer, and correctness of each question, click to expand Trajectory to view the complete reasoning track |

### Compare (multi-run comparison)

Check 2 or more runs from the Runs list and click **Compare** to enter the comparison page.

- Display summary indicators of each run side by side
- Line-by-line comparison by topic: the answers and correct or incorrect status of each question in each run are clear at a glance
- Suitable for comparing the performance of different agents and different models under the same benchmark

### Jobs (task management)

View all created assessment tasks:

- **Progress Bar**: Real-time display of completed/total number of tasks. On resume, the bar shows only the delta for the new attempt (not counting previously completed tasks again).
- **Real-time accuracy**: dynamically updated as tasks are completed
- **Log Drawer**: Click on any task to expand and view real-time logs (logs do not interfere with each other when multiple tasks are concurrent). On resume, old logs are preserved above a separator line.
- **Cancel**: Click Cancel on a running task to mark it as canceled.
- **Continue**: Resume an interrupted or failed job. For OpenClaw jobs, sandboxes are re-deployed automatically; completed tasks are always skipped.
- **Delete**: Remove a job entry from the list (does not delete result data in `results/`).

> Note: The task status is only saved in memory. The historical task records will be cleared after restarting the backend, but the JSONL file in `results/` will not be affected.

### New Evaluation

Configure and submit assessment tasks through forms, supporting two types of agents:

#### Direct LLM

Good for quick baseline testing, no ROCK sandbox required.

| Field | Description |
|------|------|
| Benchmark | Choose preset benchmark or customize (AIME 2024/2025/2026, HMMT, SMT, CMIMC, BRUMO, etc.) |
| Model | OpenAI API-compatible model name (such as `moonshotai/kimi-k2.5`) |
| API Base URL | Model service address (such as `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/`) |
| API Key | Paste directly, or enter `$VARIABLE_NAME` to reference the key in `.env`. Quick-fill tags auto-suggest based on the API Base URL domain. |
| Temperature | Sampling temperature (default 0.6) |
| Top P | Nucleus sampling probability (leave empty to use model default) |
| Max Tokens | Maximum tokens per response (default 32768) |
| Max Concurrent | Number of concurrent tasks |
| Num Samples | Number of samples for each question (automatically calculates pass@k/avg@k when > 1) |

#### OpenClaw (requires ROCK sandbox)

Two operations are provided:

**Deploy & Run**: Fill in the model API configuration and evaluation configuration. After submission, the Dashboard will:
1. Deploy sandboxes in the background — one per concurrent task (allow ~5–10 minutes including `npm install`)
2. Automatically probe gateway health
3. Start evaluation automatically once all sandboxes are healthy

The entire process can be monitored on the Jobs page.

| Field | Description |
|------|------|
| Model API Base URL | API base for the model running inside the sandbox (e.g. `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/`) |
| Model Name | Model identifier forwarded to the gateway (e.g. `moonshotai/kimi-k2.5`) |
| Model API Key | Key for the model API. Use `$ENV_VAR` to reference `.env` (auto-suggested by domain). |
| Temperature / Top P / Max Tokens | Generation parameters forwarded to the sandbox gateway |
| System Prompt | Instruction prepended to each task. Leave empty to use the built-in default (shown as grey placeholder). |
| Concurrency | Number of parallel tasks = number of sandboxes deployed. Higher values use more resources. |

> **Continue / Resume**: If a job is interrupted (e.g. server restart), click **Continue** on the Jobs page. For OpenClaw jobs, sandboxes will be re-deployed automatically. Completed tasks are always skipped unless "Redo All" was used.

## API Key configuration

The API Key input box supports two modes:

**Paste directly**: Paste the complete key in the input box.

**Referencing environment variables**: Enter `$VARIABLE_NAME` (such as `$OPENROUTER_API_KEY`), and the backend will read the actual value from the `.env` file in the project root directory or from a system environment variable. The key will not be exposed in the API response.

Create the `.env` file in the project root directory:


```bash
cat > .env <<'EOF'
OPENROUTER_API_KEY="sk-or-v1-xxxxxxxx"
OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-xxxxxxxx"
SILICONFLOW_API_KEY="sk-xxxxxxxx"
ARK_API_KEY="xxxxxxxx"
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY="sk-xxxxxxxx"
EOF
```


When entering the API Base URL, Dashboard will automatically match and fill in the corresponding variable name based on the domain name:

| API Base URL | Automatch variables |
|---|---|
| `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/` | `$OPENROUTER_API_KEY` |
| `https://api.openai.com/v1/` | `$OPENAI_API_KEY` |
| `https://api.siliconflow.cn/v1/` | `$SILICONFLOW_API_KEY` |
| `https://ark.cn-beijing.volces.com/api/...` | `$ARK_API_KEY` |
| `https://api.deepseek.com/v1/` | `$DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` |

## Environment Variable Reference

| Variable | Default | Description |
|------|--------|------|
| `ALPHADIANA_RESULTS_DIR` | `./results` | Directory to store `.jsonl` result files |
| `ALPHADIANA_CONFIGS_DIR` | `./configs` | Directory to store the `.yaml` configuration file (automatically written by Dashboard) |
| `ALPHADIANA_BACKEND_PORT` | `8000` | Backend preferred port (automatically incremented when occupied) |
| `ALPHADIANA_FRONTEND_PORT` | `5173` | Front-end preferred port (automatically incremented when occupied) |
| `ROCK_BASE_URL` | Automatic detection | ROCK admin URL, usually injected by `scripts/rock_env.sh` |
| `ROCK_PROXY_URL` | Automatic detection | ROCK proxy URL, usually injected by `scripts/rock_env.sh` |
| `HF_ENDPOINT` | `https://hf-mirror.com` | HuggingFace mirror site (automatically used when not set) |

Port variables are automatically handled by `run.sh` and usually do not need to be set manually.

## Scorer Reference

| Scorer | When to use | Notes |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| **Math Verify** (`math_verify`) | Math competition problems (AIME, HMMT, etc.) — **recommended default** | Uses math-verify/SymPy for symbolic equivalence. Handles LaTeX, fractions, equivalent expressions (√2/2 = 1/√2). Falls back to normalized string comparison when parsing fails. Requires `pip install math-verify`. |
| **Numeric** (`numeric`) | Integer or decimal answers only | Compares numeric values with configurable tolerance (default 1e-6). Fails if the predicted answer cannot be parsed as a number. |
| **Exact Match** (`exact_match`) | String answers where reformulation should not count | Math-aware string normalization then strict equality. Does not equate equivalent expressions (1/2 ≠ 0.5). |
| **LLM Judge** (`llm_judge`) | Open-ended or descriptive answers | Uses an LLM API to judge correctness. Requires additional scorer config: `api_base`, `api_key`, `model` (not exposed in the UI form — set via YAML or API). |

## FAQ

**Q: Startup shows `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'fastapi'`**


```bash
pip install -e '.[dashboard]'
```


**Q: The frontend cannot be opened, or it shows "Cannot connect to backend"**

Confirm that the backend is started and `VITE_BACKEND_PORT` is consistent with the actual port of the backend:


```bash
# Development Mode: Starting with run.sh will automatically sync the ports
cd alphadiana/dashboard && ./run.sh
```


**Q: Jobs page logs are out of order or confused**

Dashboard uses `contextvars` to isolate the logs of concurrent tasks. In Python 3.12+, ThreadPoolExecutor child threads will also inherit the context correctly. If running Python 3.10/3.11, there may be slight aliasing in the concurrent task logs, but this does not affect the result files.

**Q: Sandbox related functions are not available (gray)**

The ROCK service is not running, or `scripts/rock_env.sh` is not sourced. Sandbox-independent functionality (browse results, Direct LLM evaluation) is still available.

**Q: The Config area of the Run Detail page is blank**

Config is automatically saved to `configs/<run_id>.yaml` by Dashboard when creating a task. Tasks started through the command line `alphadiana run` will not automatically generate this file. You need to manually copy the configuration file to the `configs/` directory.

**Q: Math Verify scorer shows "No symbolic match" on clearly correct answers**

The `math-verify` library is not installed or failed to parse the expression. Install it:

```bash
pip install math-verify
```

If the error persists, the scorer will automatically fall back to normalized string comparison.

**Q: After pulling new code, the dashboard UI doesn't reflect the changes**

In production mode, you need to rebuild the frontend:

```bash
cd alphadiana/dashboard/frontend && npm install && npm run build && cd ../../..
```

Also run `pip install -e '.[all]'` to pick up any new Python dependencies.
